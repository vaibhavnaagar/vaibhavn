  desc: I am a graduate student in the Cybersecurity at the College Of Computing in Georgia Tech. I am broadly interested in Cybersecurity and Networking. I am passionate about coding and learning new things in life which are mostly related to computer science, physics and universe. Apart from academic pursuits, in free time I like to watch anime and videos from vsauce, Kurzgesagt and other science channels. Other than that I like to play Badminton, chess, table tennis, computer games and love to swim.
